## This is an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting student performance. 

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to:

Structure a machine learning project properly.

Create and manage environments for development.

Build reusable pipelines for preprocessing and model training.

Use Flask for deploying machine learning models as a web application.

Organize project folders for better understanding and maintenance.


## Project Structure

artifacts/: Contains data files, preprocessed data, and trained models.

notebook/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.

src/: Main source code folder with:

Components for pipeline creation.

Utility functions, logging, and exception handling.

templates/: HTML files for the web application.

application.py: Main Flask app for running the project.
 
## This project was created for learning purpose.
